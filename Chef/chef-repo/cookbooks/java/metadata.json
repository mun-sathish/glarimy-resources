It defaults to installing OpenJDK, but it can also install Oracle, IBM JDKs or AdoptOpenJDK.\n\n## Maintainers\n\nThis cookbook is maintained by the Sous Chefs. The Sous Chefs are a community of Chef cookbook maintainers working together to maintain important cookbooks. If youâ€™d like to know more please visit [sous-chefs.org](https://sous-chefs.org/) or come chat with us on the Chef Community Slack in [#sous-chefs](https://chefcommunity.slack.com/messages/C2V7B88SF).\n\n## Production Deployment with Oracle Java\n\nOracle has been known to change the behavior of its download site frequently. It is recommended you store the archives on an artifact server or s3 bucket. You can then override the attributes in a cookbook, role, or environment:\n\n```ruby\ndefault['java']['jdk_version'] = '8'\ndefault['java']['install_flavor'] = 'oracle'\ndefault['java']['jdk']['7']['x86_64']['url'] = 'http://artifactory.example.com/artifacts/jdk-7u65-linux-x64.tar.gz'\ndefault['java']['jdk']['7']['x86_64']['checksum'] = 'The SHA-256 checksum of the JDK archive'\ndefault['java']['oracle']['accept_oracle_download_terms'] = true\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nInclude the `java` recipe wherever you would like Java installed, such as a run list (`recipe[java]`) or a cookbook (`include_recipe 'java'`). By default, OpenJDK 6 is installed. The `install_flavor` attribute is used to determine which JDK to install (AdoptOpenJDK, OpenJDK, Oracle, IBM, or Windows), and `jdk_version` specifies which version to install (currently 6 and 7 are supported for all JDK types, 8 and 10 for Oracle and AdoptOpenJDK ).\n\n### Examples\n\nTo install Oracle Java 7 (note that when installing Oracle JDK, `accept_oracle_download_terms` attribute must be set -- see below role for an example):\n\n```ruby\nname \"java\"\ndescription \"Install Oracle Java\"\ndefault_attributes(\n  \"java\" => {\n    \"install_flavor\" => \"oracle\",\n    \"jdk_version\" => \"7\",\n    \"oracle\" => {\n      \"accept_oracle_download_terms\" => true\n    }\n  }\n)\nrun_list(\n  \"recipe[java]\"\n)\n```\n\nExample role to install IBM flavored Java:\n\n```ruby\nname \"java\"\ndescription \"Install IBM Java on Ubuntu\"\ndefault_attributes(\n  \"java\" => {\n    \"install_flavor\" => \"ibm\",\n    \"ibm\" => {\n      \"accept_ibm_download_terms\" => true,\n      \"url\" => \"http://fileserver.example.com/ibm-java-x86_64-sdk-7.0-4.1.bin\",\n      \"checksum\" => \"The SHA256 checksum of the bin\"\n    }\n  }\n)\nrun_list(\n  \"recipe[java]\"\n)\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nChef 13.4+\n\n### Platforms\n\n- Debian, Ubuntu\n- CentOS, RedHat, Fedora, Scientific, Amazon\n- ArchLinux\n- FreeBSD\n- Windows\n- macOS\n\n### Cookbooks\n\n- homebrew\n\n## Attributes\n\nSee `attributes/default.rb` for default values.\n\n- `node['java']['download_path']` - Location to download and extract the tarball\n- `node['java']['install_flavor']` - Flavor of JVM you would like installed (`oracle`, `oracle_rpm`, `openjdk`, `adoptopenjdk`, `ibm`, `windows`), default `openjdk` on Linux/Unix platforms, `windows` on Windows platforms.\n- `node['java']['install_type']` - Type of Java installation, defauls to jdk, needed for JCE to find the install path of jar's for JDK/JRE installation.\n- `node['java']['jdk_version']` - JDK version to install, defaults to `'6'`.\n- `node['java']['java_home']` - Default location of the \"`$JAVA_HOME`\".

By default the `openjdk` flavor of Java is installed, but this can be changed by using the `install_flavor` attribute. By default on Windows platform systems, the `install_flavor` is `windows` and on Mac OS X platform systems, the `install_flavor` is `homebrew`.\n\nOpenJDK is the default because of licensing changes made upstream by Oracle. See notes on the `oracle` recipe below.\n\nNOTE: In most cases, including just the default recipe will be sufficient. It's possible to include the install_type recipes directly, as long as the necessary attributes (such as java_home) are set.\n\n### set_attributes_from_version\n\nSets default attributes based on the JDK version. This is included by `default.rb`. This logic must be in a recipe instead of attributes/default.rb. See [#95](https://github.com/agileorbit-cookbooks/java/pull/95) for details.\n\n### default_java_symlink\n\nUpdates /usr/lib/jvm/default-java to point to JAVA_HOME.\n\n### openjdk\n\nThis recipe installs the `openjdk` flavor of Java. It also uses the `alternatives` system on RHEL/Debian families to set the default Java.\n\nOn platforms such as SmartOS that require the acceptance of a license agreement during package installation, set `node['java']['accept_license_agreement']` to true in order to indicate that you accept the license.\n\n### oracle\n\nThis recipe installs the `oracle` flavor of Java. This recipe does not use distribution packages as Oracle changed the licensing terms with JDK 1.6u27 and prohibited the practice for both RHEL and Debian family platforms.\n\nYou can not directly download the JDK from Oracle's website without using a special cookie. This cookbook uses that cookie to download the oracle recipe on your behalf, however the `java::oracle` recipe forces you to set either override the `node['java']['oracle']['accept_oracle_download_terms']` to true or set up a private repository accessible by HTTP.\n\noverride the `accept_oracle_download_terms` in, e.g., `roles/base.rb`\n\n```ruby\n    default_attributes(\n      :java => {\n         :oracle => {\n           \"accept_oracle_download_terms\" => true\n         }\n       }\n    )\n```\n\nFor both RHEL and Debian families, this recipe pulls the binary distribution from the Oracle website, and installs it in the default `JAVA_HOME` for each distribution. For Debian, this is `/usr/lib/jvm/default-java`. For RHEL, this is `/usr/lib/jvm/java`.\n\nAfter putting the binaries in place, the `java::oracle` recipe updates `/usr/bin/java` to point to the installed JDK using the `update-alternatives` script. This is all handled in the `java_oracle_install` resource.\n\n### oracle_i386\n\nThis recipe installs the 32-bit Java virtual machine without setting it as the default. This can be useful if you have applications on the same machine that require different versions of the JVM.\n\nThis recipe operates in a similar manner to `java::oracle`.\n\n### oracle_rpm\n\nThis recipe installs the Oracle JRE or JDK provided by a custom YUM repositories. It also uses the `alternatives` system on RHEL families to set the default Java.\n\nWhile public YUM repos for Oracle Java 7 and prior are available, you need to download the RPMs manually for Java 8 and make your own internal repository. This must be done to use this recipe to install Oracle Java 8 via RPM. You will also likely need to set `node['java']['oracle_rpm']['package_name']` to `jdk1.8.0_40`, replacing `40` with the most current version in your local repo.\n\n### adoptopenjdk\n\nThis recipe installs the `AdoptOpenJDK` flavor of Java from [https://adoptopenjdk.net/](https://adoptopenjdk.net/). It also uses the `alternatives` system on the RHEL/Debian families to set the default Java.\n\n### Amazon Corretto\n\nThis recipe installs the `Amazon Corretto` flavor of OpenJDK from [https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/).  It also uses the `alternatives` system on RHEL/Debian families to set the default Java.\n\n### windows\n\nBecause as of 26 March 2012 you can no longer directly download the JDK msi from Oracle's website without using a special cookie. This recipe requires you to set `node['java']['oracle']['accept_oracle_download_terms']` to true or host it internally on your own http repo or s3 bucket.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**\n\nIf you use the `windows` recipe, you'll need to make sure you've uploaded the `aws` and `windows` cookbooks. As of version 1.18.0, this cookbook references them with `suggests` instead of `depends`, as they are only used by the `windows` recipe.\n\n### ibm\n\nThe `java::ibm` recipe is used to install the IBM version of Java. Note that IBM requires you to create an account _and_ log in to download the binary installer for your platform. You must accept the license agreement with IBM to use their version of Java. In this cookbook, you indicate this by setting `node['java']['ibm']['accept_ibm_download_terms']` to `true`. You must also host the binary on your own HTTP server to have an automated installation. The `node['java']['ibm']['url']` attribute must be set to a valid https/http URL; the URL is checked for validity in the recipe.\n\nAt this time the `java::ibm` recipe does not support multiple SDK installations.\n\n### notify\n\nThe `java::notify` recipe contains a log resource whose `:write` action is called when a JDK version changes. This gives cookbook authors a way to subscribe to JDK changes and take actions (say restart a java service):\n\n```ruby\nservice 'somejavaservice' do\n  action :restart\n  subscribes :restart, 'log[jdk-version-changed]', :delayed\nend\n```\n\n## Resources\n\n### java_oracle_install\n\nThis cookbook contains the `java_oracle_install` resource which handles installation of Oracle's distribution of Java..\n\nBy default, the extracted directory is extracted to `app_root/extracted_dir_name` and symlinked to `app_root/default`\n\n#### Actions\n\n- `:install`: extracts the tarball and makes necessary symlinks\n- `:remove`: removes the tarball and run update-alternatives for all symlinked `bin_cmds`\n\n#### Attribute Parameters\n\n- `url`: path to tarball, .tar.gz, .bin (oracle-specific), and .zip currently supported\n- `checksum`: SHA256 checksum, not used for security but avoid redownloading the archive on each chef-client run\n- `app_home`: the default for installations of this type of application, for example, `/usr/lib/tomcat/default`.

It can also populate the keystore with a certificate retrieved from a given SSL end-point. It defaults to the default keystore `<java_home>/jre/lib/security/cacerts` for Java 8 or below and `<java_home>/lib/security/cacerts` for Java 9+ with the default password if a specific keystore is not provided.\n\n### Actions\n\n- `:install`: installs a certificate.\n- `:remove`: removes a certificate.\n\n### Attribute Parameters\n\n- `cert_alias`: The alias of the certificate in the keystore.

It defaults to installing the JCE files into the Java location defined by cookbook attributes, but it can be customized to install to arbitrary Java locations.  Please note that if `node['java']['oracle']['jce']['enabled']` is set to true, this custom resource will be run automatically.\n\n### Actions\n\n- `:install`: Installs the JCE policy files.\n\n### Attribute Parameters\n\nNo attributes are required by this resource.\n\nOptional parameters:\n\n- `jdk_version`: The Java version to install into. Defaults to `node['java']['jdk_version']`.\n- `jce_url`: The URL for the JCE distribution. Defaults to `node['java']['oracle']['jce'][jdk_version]['url']`.\n- `jce_checksum`: The checksum of the JCE distribution. Defaults to `node['java']['oracle']['jce'][jdk_version]['checksum']`.\n- `jce_cookie`: Indicates that you accept Oracle's EULA.

Defaults to `node['java']['oracle']['jce']['home']`.\n- `java_home`: The location of the Java installation.. Defaults to `node['java']['java_home']`.\n- `principal`: For Windows installations only, this determines the owner of the JCE files. Defaults to `node['java']['windows']['owner']`.\n\n### Examples\n\n``` ruby\n# Install the JCE for the default Java installation:\njava_jce  \"Install the JCE files\" do\nend\n\n# Install the JCE for a Java installation in /opt/tools/jdk8:\njava_jce \"Install the JCE files\" do\n  java_home \"/opt/tools/jdk8\"\nend\n\n# Install the JCE for a Java 8 installation in /opt/tools/java using a custom download location:\njava_jce \"Install the JCE files\" do\n  java_home \"/opt/tools/java\"\n  jdk_version \"8\"\n  jce_url \"https://artifacts/path/to/jce/policy.zip\"\n  jce_checksum \"deadbeefcafe...\"\nend\n```\n\n## Recommendations for inclusion in community cookbooks\n\nThis cookbook is a dependency for many other cookbooks in the Java/Chef sphere. Here are some guidelines for including it into other cookbooks:\n\n### Allow people to not use this cookbook\n\nMany users manage Java on their own or have systems that already have java installed. Give these users an option to skip this cookbook, for example:\n\n```ruby\ninclude_recipe 'java' if node['maven']['install_java']\n```\n\nThis would allow a users of the maven cookbook to choose if they want the maven cookbook to install java for them or leave that up to the consumer.\n\nAnother good example is from the [Jenkins Cookbook Java recipe](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/jenkins/commit/ca2a69d982011dc1bec6a6d0ee4da5c1a1599864).\n\n### Pinning to major version of cookbook and Java\n\nThis cookbook follows semver. It is recommended to pin at the major version of this cookbook when including it in other cookbooks, eg: `depends 'java', '~> 1.0'`\n\nIt is acceptable to set the `node['java']['jdk_version']` to a specific version if required for your software to run, eg software xyz requires Java 8 to run. Refrain from pinning to specific patches of the JDK to allow users to consume security updates.\n\n## Development\n\nThis cookbook uses [test-kitchen](https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen) for integration tests and [ChefSpec/RSpec](https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec) for unit tests. See [TESTING.md](https://github.com/agileorbit-cookbooks/java/blob/master/TESTING.md) for testing instructions.\n\nAt this time due to licensing concerns, the IBM recipe is not set up in test kitchen. If you would like to test this locally, copy .kitchen.yml to .kitchen.local.yml and add the following suite:\n\n```yml\nsuites:\n- name: ibm\n  run_list: [\"recipe[java]\"]\n  attributes:\n    java:\n      install_flavor: \"ibm\"\n      ibm:\n        accept_ibm_download_terms: true\n        url: \"http://jenkins/ibm-java-x86_64-sdk-7.0-4.1.bin\"\n        checksum: the-sha256-checksum\n```\n\nLog into the IBM DeveloperWorks site to download a copy of the IBM Java SDK you wish to use/test, host it on an internal HTTP server, and calculate the SHA256 checksum to use in the suite.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who [contribute.](https://opencollective.com/sous-chefs/contributors.svg?width=890&button=false)\n\n### Backers\n\nThank you to all our backers!\n\n![https://opencollective.com/sous-chefs#backers](https://opencollective.com/sous-chefs/backers.svg?width=600&avatarHeight=40)\n\n### Sponsors\n\nSupport this project by becoming a sponsor.
