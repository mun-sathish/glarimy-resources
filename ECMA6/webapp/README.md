### How to run ###

Install the dependecies which include http-server.
```
$npm install
```

Run the web server and note down the port number of the http-server. Usually it is 8080.
```
#npm start
```

Open a browser and visit http://localhost:8080 (change the port number, if http-server starts on a different port)
